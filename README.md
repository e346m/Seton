## Seton
Seton is a tool for Github issue tracking across repositories so far.
For example you can track bug issues of libraries used in your project without visiting each repository. Or let say you want to track only a certain level issues of libraries, you can.

## Naming & Goal
From E. T. Seton's quote "there is no animal that cannot be tracked" Seton is supposed to track issues.
